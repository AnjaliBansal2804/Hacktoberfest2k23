## Rules for Adding a Questions

1. **Ownership**: You can only add projects and code that belong to you. We encourage you to showcase your own work and contribute projects that you have personally developed.

2. **Originality**: Do not add projects that are not your own or copy-paste code from websites, tutorials, or other sources. We value original contributions that reflect your skills and creativity.
